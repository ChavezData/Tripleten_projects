About

In this project, I use linear algebra to help The Sure Tomorrow Insurance Company better understand and manage its risk portfolio.
The project involves working with systems of linear equations, matrix operations, and optimization techniques to estimate potential losses and propose strategies to minimize financial risk.

The focus is on applying theoretical math concepts to solve practical business problems.

Dataset

The data includes:
	•	Insurance claims
	•	Loss amounts
	•	Probabilities of different risk events
	•	Client profiles

(All data provided as part of the TripleTen curriculum.)

Project Objectives
	•	Apply linear algebra techniques (matrix algebra, vector spaces) to insurance risk modeling
	•	Build systems of equations to represent claim and loss scenarios
	•	Find optimal solutions minimizing risk and maximizing expected return
	•	Translate mathematical results into actionable business insights

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	NumPy
	•	Pandas
	•	SciPy
	•	Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Tripleten_projects.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tripleten_projects/Linear_Algebra

	3.	Open the notebook:

You can open Project 11_Linear_Algebra(The_Sure_Tomorrow_Insurance_Company).ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
	4.	Install the required Python packages:

pip install numpy pandas scipy

	5.	Run the notebook cells sequentially.

Analytical Approach
	•	Matrix Construction:
	•	Create matrices representing insurance claims and payouts.
	•	Solving Systems of Equations:
	•	Solve for unknowns such as expected losses using matrix inversion and other techniques.
	•	Optimization:
	•	Find optimal client portfolios using linear programming to minimize risk exposure.
	•	Interpretation:
	•	Translate the mathematical results into business strategies for risk mitigation.

Key Findings
	•	Developed a matrix-based model to predict expected losses across different client groups.
	•	Proposed an optimized client mix that minimizes financial risk while maintaining profitability.
	•	Demonstrated how mathematical modeling can significantly enhance insurance underwriting processes.

(Complete mathematical formulations, Python code, and business insights are available in the notebook.)

Would you also like me to create an optional “Math Techniques Glossary” you could add at the end of the README?
(It would briefly explain terms like matrix multiplication, system solving, optimization — super useful for non-technical readers or recruiters!)
Let me know!
