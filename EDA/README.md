About

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn for a telecom provider.
The goal is to understand:
	•	Who is most likely to churn?
	•	What services or customer behaviors predict churn?
	•	How demographic and account factors relate to churn?

Through data cleaning, visualization, and descriptive statistics, the project uncovers valuable business insights.

Dataset

The dataset includes information such as:
	•	Customer demographics (gender, age, partner/dependents)
	•	Account information (contract type, tenure, monthly charges, etc.)
	•	Services signed up for (internet service, phone service, etc.)
	•	Churn indicator (whether the customer has left)

(Data provided as part of the TripleTen curriculum.)

Project Objectives
	•	Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, correct data types)
	•	Explore feature distributions and relationships
	•	Identify key patterns linked to customer churn
	•	Support further modeling and prediction efforts with strong data insights

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Tripleten_projects.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tripleten_projects/EDA

	3.	Open the notebook:

You can open Project 2_EDA.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Install required libraries if necessary:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Then run the notebook cells sequentially.

Key Findings
	•	Customers with month-to-month contracts showed a higher churn rate compared to those with longer-term contracts.
	•	Higher monthly charges correlated with a greater likelihood of churn.
	•	Internet service type and additional service subscriptions impacted churn likelihood.
	•	Customers without partners or dependents had a slightly higher churn rate.
