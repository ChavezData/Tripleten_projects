About

This project focuses on analyzing video game sales data to identify trends and patterns over time.
The analysis investigates questions like:
	•	When was the “golden age” of video games?
	•	Which platforms and genres dominated the market?
	•	What impact did critics’ and users’ ratings have on game sales?

The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

Dataset

The dataset includes information about:
	•	Game names

Would you also like a slightly fancier version with a project banner or badges (e.g., Python version, Jupyter, License badges)? I can whip that up too if you want!
