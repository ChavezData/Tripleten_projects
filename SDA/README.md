About

This project applies statistical techniques to analyze differences in customer behavior for a telecom company.
The main focus is on hypothesis testing to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between customer groups — for example, between users of different services or plans.

The project includes:
	•	Formulating null and alternative hypotheses
	•	Testing assumptions (e.g., normality, equal variances)
	•	Choosing appropriate statistical tests
	•	Drawing conclusions based on p-values and significance levels

Dataset

The dataset includes variables such as:
	•	Revenue information
	•	Service types
	•	Customer demographics
	•	Tenure and plan types

(Data provided as part of the TripleTen curriculum.)

Project Objectives
	•	Explore and preprocess the dataset
	•	Formulate relevant business hypotheses
	•	Conduct statistical tests (e.g., two-sample t-tests)
	•	Interpret the results in a business context
	•	Provide recommendations based on the findings

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	Scipy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Tripleten_projects.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tripleten_projects/SDA

	3.	Open the notebook:

You can open Project 3_Statistical_Data_Analysis.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn

Then run the notebook cells in order.

Key Methods
	•	Formulation of Hypotheses: Clearly defining null and alternative hypotheses for business questions.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis: Checking distributions, detecting outliers.
	•	Normality Testing: Using Shapiro-Wilk test.
	•	Variance Testing: Using Levene’s test to determine if variances are equal.
	•	Two-Sample t-Test: Comparing means between two groups.

Key Findings
	•	Statistical testing revealed whether there were significant differences in average revenue between different customer groups.
	•	Proper testing methodology (checking assumptions) was crucial for valid conclusions.
	•	Business insights derived from the results can guide product and service improvements.
