About

In this final project, I analyze interconnect call data for a telecom company to understand usage patterns, uncover inefficiencies, and suggest data-driven strategies to optimize operations and reduce costs.
The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical insights to deliver actionable business recommendations.

This project reflects the culmination of skills developed throughout the TripleTen program, blending SQL, Python, data analysis, and business problem-solving.

Dataset

The dataset includes call records with features such as:
	•	Call start and end times
	•	Call type (e.g., interconnect, internal)
	•	Operator names
	•	Tariffs and billing information
	•	Duration and traffic volume

(Data provided as part of the TripleTen curriculum.)

Project Objectives
	•	Understand interconnect call traffic patterns
	•	Identify inefficiencies or anomalies in operator partnerships
	•	Analyze call durations, costs, and revenue impacts
	•	Recommend operational or contractual optimizations to management

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	SQL (for data extraction)
	•	Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Tripleten_projects.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tripleten_projects/Final_Project

	3.	Open the notebook:

You can open Project 17_Final_Project(telecom_operator_interconnect).ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
	4.	Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

	5.	(Optional) Set up a local SQL environment if you want to practice running the raw data extraction queries.

Analytical Approach
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Traffic patterns across operators
	•	Distribution of call durations and volumes
	•	Cost Analysis:
	•	Examination of call costs vs. revenues
	•	Detection of high-cost, low-revenue partnerships
	•	Visualization:
	•	Trends in interconnect usage over time
	•	Top/bottom-performing operators
	•	Business Recommendations:
	•	Optimization strategies for partnerships and billing

Key Findings
	•	Certain operators were responsible for a disproportionate share of costs with limited revenue return.
	•	Peak interconnect traffic periods were identified, offering opportunities for renegotiating tariffs.
	•	Specific call types and durations correlated strongly with financial losses or gains.
	•	Actionable insights were proposed to improve profitability and operational efficiency.

(Full results and visualizations are included in the notebook.)
