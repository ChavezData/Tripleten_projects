About

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to automate the classification of seeds as either “good” or “bad” based on their images.
Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model learns to identify visual patterns that distinguish seed quality — supporting faster and more accurate sorting processes in agriculture and production lines.

Dataset

The dataset consists of seed images labeled as either:
	•	Good seeds (healthy, high quality)
	•	Bad seeds (defective, low quality)

Images vary in size, orientation, and quality, providing a realistic challenge for computer vision modeling.

(Data provided as part of the TripleTen curriculum.)

Project Objectives
	•	Preprocess image data for model training
	•	Build and train a CNN architecture
	•	Evaluate model performance on validation and test sets
	•	Optimize model parameters to improve accuracy
	•	Apply computer vision techniques to a real-world quality control problem

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	TensorFlow / Keras
	•	Pandas
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Tripleten_projects.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tripleten_projects/Computer_Vision

	3.	Open the notebook:

You can open Project 15_Computer_Vision(Good_Seed).ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
	4.	Install the required libraries if necessary:

pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib seaborn

	5.	Ensure the dataset is available in the expected directory structure if re-running model training.
	6.	Run the notebook cells sequentially.

Modeling Approach
	•	Image Preprocessing:
	•	Rescaling pixel values
	•	Data augmentation (optional) to increase training data variability
	•	CNN Architecture:
	•	Stacked convolutional and pooling layers
	•	Dense fully connected layers for final classification
	•	Evaluation:
	•	Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
	•	Early stopping and model checkpointing for better generalization

Key Findings
	•	The CNN model successfully learned to classify seeds with high accuracy.
	•	Proper image preprocessing and tuning of CNN architecture significantly improved performance.
	•	The project demonstrates the value of computer vision in automating manual quality inspection tasks.

Would you also like me to create an extra version where I add a small “Model Architecture Diagram” you could include in the README?
(Like a simple block diagram of the CNN flow: Input -> Conv -> Pool -> Conv -> Pool -> Dense -> Output?)
It could make the repo even more visually attractive!
Let me know!
