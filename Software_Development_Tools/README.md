About

This project focuses on implementing software development tools and practices in a data analysis context.
The goal is to ensure code reliability and data quality while analyzing a dataset of used vehicles sold in the U.S. by using:
	•	Assertions for data validation
	•	Functions with built-in checks
	•	Unit testing frameworks

The project emphasizes writing clean, robust, and testable Python code.

Dataset

The dataset includes information about used vehicles, such as:
	•	Model year
	•	Manufacturer
	•	Model
	•	Condition
	•	Price
	•	Odometer readings
	•	Location

(Data provided as part of the TripleTen curriculum.)

Project Objectives
	•	Explore and clean the dataset
	•	Validate data assumptions with assertions
	•	Implement reusable functions for data processing
	•	Develop unit tests to check function behavior
	•	Practice writing defensive, production-ready code

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	Pytest (for unit testing)
	•	Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Tripleten_projects.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tripleten_projects/Software_Development_Tools

	3.	Open the notebook:

You can open Project 4_Software_Development_Tools(Vehicles_US).ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install pandas pytest

	4.	(Optional) Run unit tests separately if provided in .py files or within the notebook.

Key Concepts
	•	Assertions: Used throughout the code to validate assumptions about data (e.g., no negative prices or odometer values).
	•	Unit Testing: Functions are tested individually to ensure correct behavior even when unexpected inputs are provided.
	•	Error Handling: Defensive programming techniques help catch problems early.

Would you also like me to create a second version of this README that’s even more “developer-oriented” (for example, with installation and testing commands highlighted more prominently)?
Or a short summary table listing all functions and tests you created? Let me know!
