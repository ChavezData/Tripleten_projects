About

In this project, I apply numerical methods and machine learning techniques to help Rusty Bargain optimize its car sales prices.
The goal is to predict car values accurately and use simulation to determine the most profitable pricing strategy based on different business scenarios.

This combines predictive modeling with business decision-making, simulating outcomes under uncertainty.

Dataset

The dataset contains:
	•	Vehicle characteristics (make, model, mileage, year, condition, etc.)
	•	Historical prices of sold cars

(Data provided as part of the TripleTen curriculum.)

Project Objectives
	•	Build a predictive model for car price estimation
	•	Use numerical simulations to estimate potential profit margins
	•	Identify optimal price points to maximize revenue
	•	Provide data-driven recommendations for sales strategy

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	SciPy
	•	Jupyter Notebook

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ChavezData/Tripleten_projects.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Tripleten_projects/Numerical_Methods

	3.	Open the notebook:

You can open Project 12_Numerical_Methods(Rusty_Bargain_used_car_sales_service).ipynb with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
	4.	Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy

	5.	Run the notebook step-by-step to reproduce the analysis.

Modeling Approach
	•	Data Preparation:
	•	Handling missing values and outliers
	•	Feature engineering for better model performance
	•	Model Training:
	•	Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) to predict car prices
	•	Numerical Simulation:
	•	Monte Carlo simulations to model different pricing scenarios
	•	Profit Analysis:
	•	Calculate expected profit based on predicted values and different price markups

Key Findings
	•	Built an accurate model for car price prediction.
	•	Simulations revealed the price range that maximizes expected profit while maintaining competitiveness.
	•	Provided recommendations for optimal pricing strategies tailored to different inventory types and market conditions.

(Detailed model performance metrics, simulation results, and business recommendations are included inside the notebook.)
